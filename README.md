# VirtualLearner
An app that help children practicing any subjects they learn in school, instead of hiring a tutor or require adult supervision to teach them, lets make the app teach them what they need to know. Keeping stress away from parents and teachers to explain everything to the child because with this app which designed with machine learning, it can help your child/students understand the concepts of what being taught in school. Reason being, children nowadays neglect to do some extra work at home or anywhere after school, even though they being told by their teachers or parents. Since young, they had given the privilege of owning their own mobile phone, hence, they are more focused on a technologies rather than their old-school textbooks.
